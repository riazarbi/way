# Implementation Constraints

## Overview
These constraints define the boundaries and requirements for the implementation of the task management system.

## Technical Constraints
1. Software Licensing
   - Must use only free and open source software
   - All dependencies must be FOSS-compatible
   - No proprietary or commercial software components

2. Codebase Size
   - Minimize total lines of code
   - Prefer built-in language features over external libraries
   - Avoid unnecessary abstractions
   - Keep the codebase as small and focused as possible

3. Dependencies
   - Minimize number of external dependencies
   - Prefer standard library solutions
   - Maximum of 5 direct dependencies
   - Each dependency must be actively maintained
   - Dependencies must be widely used and stable

4. Programming Language
   - Use only one programming language throughout the entire stack
   - No mixing of languages for different components
   - Language must be well-suited for both frontend and backend
   - Language must have strong community support
