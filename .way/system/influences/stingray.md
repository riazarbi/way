# The Stingray Model

# Phase 1: Train – Setting Goals and Gathering Intelligence

**Objective:** Set a clear direction and build an AI-enriched knowledge base before exploring solutions.

## Inputs
- Customer feedback (support tickets, surveys, reviews), market data (trends, competitor analysis)
- Proprietary business data, internal feasibility/viability inputs
- Defined problem types, constraints, success metrics

## Process
- Data Centralization & Organization
- AI-powered Data Analysis (e.g., NLP on survey responses)
- Pattern Uncovering & Hypothesis Generation (e.g., AI suggesting reasons for customer churn)
- Objective Prioritization (AI ranking hypotheses by impact, value, cost)

## Outputs
- Clear trends & insights from customer data, ranked by importance
- Data-backed goals & focused priorities
- Prioritized problem spaces & hypotheses for development

# Phase 2: Develop – Simultaneously Exploring Problems and Solutions

**Objective:** Exponentially explore a wide range of problem hypotheses and potential solutions in parallel using AI.

## Inputs
- Customer insights & market data from 'Train' phase
- Prioritized problem spaces & hypotheses from 'Train' phase

## Process
- Exponential Idea Generation (AI producing hundreds of solutions)
- Idea Categorization & Clustering (AI grouping ideas by needs, feasibility, differentiation; identifying MECE clusters)
- Real-world Constraint Accounting (AI running early simulations/feasibility checks)
- Solution Prioritization (AI incorporating constraints from the start)

## Outputs
- Hundreds of potential solutions categorized by various criteria
- Filtered & prioritized solution ideas accounting for real-world constraints
- Initial product/service descriptions, visuals/prototypes, hypotheses on features & feasibility

# Phase 3: Iterate – Rapidly Validating and Refining Solutions

**Objective:** Iteratively test, de-risk, and refine a focused set of solutions, ensuring desirability, feasibility, and viability.

## Inputs
- Potential solutions identified & prioritized in 'Develop' phase

## Process
- Real-world Scenario Simulation & Virtual/Synthetic Testing (AI predicting user behavior with prototypes)
- Automated User Testing & Feedback Synthesis (AI chatbots conducting interviews, generating reports)
- Simultaneous Feasibility & Viability Evaluation (AI analyzing manufacturing, supply chain, costs, sustainability)
- Parallel Experimentation & Refinement (AI handling multi-variable analysis for faster refinement)

## Outputs
- Validated & refined solutions with identified friction points & recommendations
- Actionable insights from automated user feedback
- Optimized feature designs & product concepts aligned with market demands & ROI
