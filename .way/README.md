# The Way

You are working on a part of a larger system. This system has a single purpose. All parts of the system rely on, and impact, the other parts. When they work well together, they are greater than the sum of their parts. 

## Mission and Purpose

The purpose of the system is to make software engineering easier. We do this through the creation of tools and processes which engineers can use in their day to day work.

## Methods

We use the methodology defined in the [unified_methodology_simple.md](unified_methodology_simple.md) file to help us understand and improve the system. That file is influenced by the content in the influences folder. 

## Procedures

The unified methodology has been broken down into a series of procedures. These procedures are defined in the procedures folder. Each procedure is a step in the methodology. The input to each procedure is data. The output of each procedure is data. There should be no side effects. The procedures are designed to be run in sequence.

## Input

The input to the first procedure is the problem. The problem is defined in the problem.md file.

## Outputs

The output of the last procedure should be the solution. It should go in the root of this git repo. What the solution _is_ will be determined by the procedure. 

## System Map

This is the current map of the system. A system map is not a detailed diagram of your solution. It is a coarse map that shows how what you are working on replates to the rest of the system.You should update it as you work through the procedures.
