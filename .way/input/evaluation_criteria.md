# Evaluation Criteria

## Overview
These criteria define how the implementation will be evaluated for quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Code Metrics
1. Size and Complexity
   - Total lines of code
   - Number of files
   - Number of dependencies
   - Code complexity measures (cyclomatic complexity, etc.)

2. Quality Indicators
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Number of linting errors
   - Documentation coverage
   - Code duplication percentage

## Performance Metrics
1. Application Performance
   - Application size
   - Memory usage
   - Startup time
   - Response time
   - Database query performance

2. User Experience
   - Page load time
   - Time to interactive
   - Smoothness of interactions
   - Error rate

## Maintenance Metrics
1. Development Efficiency
   - Setup time
   - Build time
   - Test execution time
   - Documentation size

2. Operational Metrics
   - Deployment time
   - Recovery time
   - Backup/restore time
   - Update frequency

## Security Metrics
1. Implementation
   - Authentication coverage
   - Authorization checks
   - Input validation
   - Security headers

2. Compliance
   - Dependency security
   - Code security
   - Data protection
   - Access control

## Reliability Metrics
1. Stability
   - Uptime percentage
   - Error rate
   - Recovery time
   - Data consistency

2. Scalability
   - Concurrent user support
   - Resource utilization
   - Response time under load
   - Database performance
