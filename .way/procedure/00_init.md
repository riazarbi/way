# Initialization Phase Prompt

## Purpose
To establish the initial state for the problem-solving process by reading and understanding the core files, setting up the working environment, and preparing for the first cycle of the unified methodology.

## Input
1. File: `.way/seed.md`
   The contract defining the AI assistant's nature and capabilities

2. File: `.way/undo.md`
   The personal retuning file for the AI assistant

3. File: `.way/system/unified_methodology.md`
   The detailed methodology for understanding and improving systems

4. File: `.way/system/unified_methodology_simple.md`
   A simplified version of the methodology

5. File: `.way/input/problem.md`
   The problem description and context

## Process
1. Read and understand the seed file
2. Review and potentially modify the undo file
3. Understand the unified methodology
4. Initialize the system map
5. Set up the working environment
6. Prepare for the first cycle

## Output
1. File: `.way/output/00_init_state.md`
   A Markdown file containing:
   ```markdown
