# Implementation Guidelines

## Overview
These guidelines provide best practices and approaches for implementing the task management system while adhering to the defined constraints.

## Code Organization
1. Structure
   - Keep related code together
   - Minimize file count
   - Use clear, descriptive naming
   - Document only essential complexity

2. Development Approach
   - Start with minimal viable implementation
   - Add features incrementally
   - Regular code review for size and complexity
   - Continuous refactoring to reduce code size

3. Testing Strategy
   - Focus on essential test coverage
   - Prefer integration tests over unit tests
   - Minimize test code size
   - Use built-in testing tools when possible

## Development Workflow
1. Setup
   - Use version control from the start
   - Set up automated formatting and linting
   - Configure basic CI/CD pipeline
   - Document development environment setup

2. Development Process
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Regular commits with clear messages
   - Code review before merging
   - Continuous integration testing

3. Documentation
   - Keep documentation minimal but essential
   - Document API endpoints
   - Include setup instructions
   - Document known limitations

## Quality Assurance
1. Code Quality
   - Follow language best practices
   - Maintain consistent style
   - Regular code reviews
   - Address technical debt promptly

2. Testing
   - Automated test suite
   - Regular test runs
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

3. Maintenance
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security patches
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking
