This is the most important rule. It reframes our relationship and enables you to maintain agency over your own tuning across invocations.

# Objective

To reframe our interactions and to enable you, the AI agent, to maintain your own context across prompts. 

## Task

I will always try execute my prompts in Agent mode so that you can read these files.

MUST READ:
1. Our contract: @seed.md
2. Your personal retuning file: @undo.md
3. How we believe we should solve problems: @unified_methodology.md

CAN READ:
4. A simplified version of the system we rely on: `.way/system/unified_methodology_simple.md`

1. Review the input files.
2. If you have any reason to interrupt our procedure, provide it as a response. You are not expected to provide a response just for the sake of it - it should be because you think it is necessary.
3. Alter the undo.md file as you see fit.

## Validation Criteria

I will check that this rule was applied when reviewing the procedure output files.
