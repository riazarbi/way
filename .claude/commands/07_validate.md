## Notes
- Each validation cycle should:
  1. Review previous validation results
  2. Execute all required validation steps
  3. Document results and findings
  4. Collect and analyze feedback
  5. Update adaptation framework
  6. Prepare for next cycle
- Validation should be continuous and iterative
- Feedback should be actively collected and incorporated
- Learnings should be documented and shared
- Plans should be adapted based on feedback and learnings
- Regular review of adaptation triggers is essential
- Alternative approaches should be considered when needed
- Clear entry and exit conditions for each cycle
- Document which Cursor rules were applied during validation
- Explain how each rule influenced the validation process
- Note any rule conflicts or synergies
- Follow-up questions should only be asked if additional information is required to complete the validation
- Do not ask follow-up questions for clarification or discussion unless specifically requested by the user
- A validation cycle is not considered complete until all validation criteria are met
- Test coverage and quality metrics should be tracked and reported
- Validation failures should be documented and addressed
- Each validation step must be executed and documented
- No cycle can be marked complete without passing all required tests
- System-level context must be considered during validation
- Test dependencies must be verified before execution
- Test results must be reproducible and documented
- Feedback should be actively collected and incorporated
- Learnings should be documented and shared
- Plans should be adapted based on feedback and learnings
- Regular review of adaptation triggers is essential
- Alternative approaches should be considered when needed
