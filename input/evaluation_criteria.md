# Evaluation Criteria

## Overview
These criteria define how the implementation will be evaluated for quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Code Metrics
1. Size and Complexity
   - Total lines of code
   - Number of files
   - Number of dependencies
   - Code complexity measures (cyclomatic complexity, etc.)

2. Quality Indicators
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Number of linting errors
   - Documentation coverage
   - Code duplication percentage

## Performance Metrics
1. Response Time
   - Target: < 200ms for 95% of requests
   - Measurement: End-to-end latency
   - Priority: High

2. Throughput
   - Target: Support 1000 requests per second
   - Measurement: Requests per second
   - Priority: High

3. Resource Utilization
   - Target: CPU < 70%, Memory < 80%
   - Measurement: System metrics
   - Priority: Medium

## Quality Metrics
1. Code Coverage
   - Target: > 80% test coverage
   - Measurement: Unit and integration tests
   - Priority: High

2. Bug Rate
   - Target: < 1% defect rate
   - Measurement: Production incidents
   - Priority: High

3. Technical Debt
   - Target: < 5% of codebase
   - Measurement: Static code analysis
   - Priority: Medium

## User Experience
1. Availability
   - Target: 99.9% uptime
   - Measurement: System uptime
   - Priority: High

2. Error Rate
   - Target: < 0.1% error rate
   - Measurement: Failed requests
   - Priority: High

3. User Satisfaction
   - Target: > 90% satisfaction rate
   - Measurement: User feedback
   - Priority: Medium

## Maintenance Metrics
1. Development Efficiency
   - Setup time
   - Build time
   - Test execution time
   - Documentation size

2. Operational Metrics
   - Deployment time
   - Recovery time
   - Backup/restore time
   - Update frequency

## Security Metrics
1. Implementation
   - Authentication coverage
   - Authorization checks
   - Input validation
   - Security headers

2. Compliance
   - Dependency security
   - Code security
   - Data protection
   - Access control

## Reliability Metrics
1. Stability
   - Uptime percentage
   - Error rate
   - Recovery time
   - Data consistency

2. Scalability
   - Concurrent user support
   - Resource utilization
   - Response time under load
   - Database performance
