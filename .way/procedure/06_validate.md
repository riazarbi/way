# Validate Phase Prompt

## Purpose
To validate the implemented solution through comprehensive testing, performance evaluation, and quality assessment, ensuring it effectively solves the original problem while meeting all constraints and following implementation guidelines.

## Input
1. Directory: `.way/output/04_implementation_plan/`
   The directory containing task files and execution results

2. File: `.way/input/constraints.md`
   The constraints that must be followed in the implementation

3. File: `.way/input/implementation_guidelines.md`
   Guidelines for implementation approach and best practices

4. File: `.way/input/evaluation_criteria.md`
   Criteria for evaluating the implementation

5. File: `.way/output/00_init_state.md`
   The initial state from the initialization phase

## Process
1. Review all completed tasks in the done/ directory
2. Analyze task execution history and validation results
3. Validate functionality against requirements
4. Assess code quality and implementation approach
5. Test against edge cases
6. Evaluate system performance
7. Analyze resource utilization
8. Assess scalability
9. Monitor system health
10. Document validation results
11. Validate constraint compliance
12. Assess guideline adherence
13. Apply evaluation criteria
14. Update the system map with validation results
15. Document learnings for the next cycle
16. Prepare feedback for the next cycle

## Output
File: `.way/output/06_validation_results.md`
A Markdown file containing:
```markdown
