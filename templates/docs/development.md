# Development Guide

## Overview
This guide provides essential practices and workflows for developing high-quality, maintainable software that meets our project standards.

## Core Principles
- **Minimalism**: Keep code simple and focused
- **Quality**: Maintain high standards with comprehensive testing
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Performance**: Meet defined performance targets
- **Documentation**: Document essential complexity only

## Code Organization

### Structure
- Keep related code together
- Minimize file count
- Use clear, descriptive naming
- Document only essential complexity

### Development Approach
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Add features incrementally
- Regular code review for size and complexity
- Continuous refactoring to reduce code size

### Testing Strategy
- Focus on essential test coverage (>80% target)
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests
- Minimize test code size
- Use built-in testing tools when possible

## Development Workflow

### Setup
- Use virtual environments for isolation
- Use version control from the start
- Set up automated formatting and linting
- Configure basic CI/CD pipeline
- Document development environment setup

### Development Process
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Regular commits with clear messages
- Code review before merging
- Continuous integration testing
- Follow Git flow branching strategy

### Documentation
- Keep documentation minimal but essential
- Document API endpoints
- Include setup instructions
- Document known limitations

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- Follow SOLID principles
- Follow language best practices
- Maintain consistent style
- Regular code reviews
- Address technical debt promptly (<5% target)

### Testing
- Automated test suite
- Regular test runs
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patches
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

## Security Guidelines
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use secure communication protocols
- Regular security audits
- Follow least privilege principle

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize for response time (<200ms target)
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use efficient data structures
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Implement proper error handling

## Agile Methodology
- Follow Agile methodology
- Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Iterative development approach
- Rapid prototyping support
