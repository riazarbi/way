# The Unified Methodology: A Simple Framework for Understanding and Improving Systems

## Introduction

This simplified framework synthesizes five related approaches to understanding and improving systems:
1. Scientific Method - A universal approach to understanding the natural world
2. Statistical Process Control (SPC) - A method for understanding and controlling variation
3. Deming's System of Profound Knowledge - A framework for understanding systems and human behavior
4. Stingray Methodology - A structured approach to problem-solving
5. DevOps/Agile - A modern approach to system development and operation
